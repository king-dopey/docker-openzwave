# DockerImages
Dockerfiles for various OZW images (forked to build more recent versions of all images). The default (latest) tag is ubuntu_python3, which utilizes the git flavor of OpenZWave, as these images are intended to be used to test new OpenZWave features and/or the administation of features, of which the home automation applicaiton in use hasn't impmenented. For a "stable" experience, using prebuilt packages and CentOS 7 the tag centos7_ozwcp is available.  

##Open ZWave Control Panel Only
centos7_ozwcp : centos7 image with ozw-controlpanel, no python. This uses prebuilt OpenZWave packges from http://mirror.my-ho.st/Downloads/OpenZWave/CentOS_CentOS-7/x86_64/
debian_ozwcp : debian image with ozw-controlpanel, no python. This use the git (bleeding edge) flavor of OpenZWave 
ubuntu_ozwcp: ubuntu image with ozw-controlpanel, no python. This use the git (bleeding edge) flavor of OpenZWave. This is the smallest image avaialbe, but adding python (below) does not require much more space.

##python-openzwave with Open ZWave Control Panel
debian/ubuntu latest for pytho2/python3 with python-openzwave in git flavor and ozw-controlpanel.
 - All versions are availables as tags in the format distro_pythonVersion : debian_python2, debian_python3, ubuntu_python2 and ubuntu_python3 (*Default)
